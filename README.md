# WeebFaction
Adds a weeaboo faction.

"A group of Okatus and Weeaboos that have been teleported to the fifty-sixth century. They aimlessly roam the lands, solely existing to spread the word of their Waifus- that is, their totally real "girlfriends". However, with no social skills to speak of, they have taken to raiding and pillaging anyone who even remotely disagrees with their faith.

They are too anti-social to be allied with."

The Weeaboo faction is a (mostly) hostile faction with unique apparel and weapons, donning cheap wigs and decorative throw pillows. All Weeaboo fighters are male, with females occupying civilian roles only, and they have the Underground and Mysogynist traits.

This mod is designed to fit right into your anime role play play through, and as a result is compatible with a large number of mods, including but not limited to:

* Vanilla Memes Expanded (uses Bushido Meme)
* Alpha Memes
* Qux Samurai Mod
* Faction Samurai
* T's Samurai Faction
* Edo Themed Expansion
* Nyaron Race
* Oni of the Rim
* Kurin Race (HAR)
* Kurin Race (Deluxe)
* Kenshi Armory
* Kenshi Apparel Pack
* Ancient Eastern Armory

Although violent towards "Normies", the Weebs have a soft spot for people that (they believe) understand them- that is, actual Japanese people. If you are playing as one of the Japanese faction mods listed above, the Weebs stop being hostile and can actually be traded with and even allied!

If you have any of the aforementioned Samurai Faction Mods, Weeaboos will spawn with Japanese names!

Some Japonic/Waifu Race Mods will cause those species to spawn alongside Weeaboos! Don't ask how they got there! There are other Mods with compatibility, such as the Gerzee Mod, which allows them to wear Weeaboo clothing.
