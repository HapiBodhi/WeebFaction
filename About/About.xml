	<description>Adds a weeaboo faction with matching apparel and weapons.

	"A group of Otakus and Weeaboos that have been isekai'd to the fifty-sixth century. They aimlessly roam the lands, solely existing to spread the word of their Waifus- that is, their totally real "girlfriends". However, with no social skills to speak of, they have taken to raiding and pillaging anyone who even remotely disagrees with their faith. 

	They are too antisocial to be allied with."
